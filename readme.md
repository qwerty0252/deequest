## dee_api

I always start with the readme cuz, I am mostly lazy to start the codingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
This is meant to be a very simple and basic npm package that can make api calls to a server.
It will abstract all the processes involved in making making api calls.
It will also be similar to the popular nodejs libray axios.
I also plan on making a cli interface for the package. The cli interface will make it easier
to make api calls on the fly. So that's it for nowðŸ™‚
